  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 3 2025</p>

  <p>
    StoryStack (“we”, “our”, or “us”) provides a tool for creators and brand managers 
    to organize, tag, sequence, and export photo stories for social media platforms.
    We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data responsibly.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

  <h3>A. Photos You Upload</h3>
  <p>
    When you upload photos into StoryStack, they are stored securely and are only accessible to your account. 
    These photos may come from:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your device’s local photo library (if you grant permission)</li>
    <li>Your camera (if you take photos inside the app)</li>
    <li>Cloud sources such as Dropbox, Google Drive, etc (if integrated)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>B. Account Information</h3>
  <p>When you create a StoryStack account, we collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Email address</li>
    <li>Password (securely hashed using industry-standard encryption)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>C. Usage Data</h3>
  <p>We may collect basic usage analytics such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>App interactions (e.g., creating a story, exporting)</li>
    <li>Device type and OS version</li>
    <li>Crash logs</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We DO NOT collect or store biometric data, precise location, or advertising identifiers.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use your information only for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To allow you to upload, organize, tag, and export story sequences</li>
    <li>To maintain and secure your account</li>
    <li>To improve app performance and stability</li>
    <li>To offer customer support</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties for advertising or marketing.</strong></p>

  <h2>3. How Your Photos Are Stored</h2>
  <p>
    StoryStack stores photos that you upload or import in your account’s private storage area.
    Only you—and services you explicitly connect (e.g., Dropbox)—have access to your photos.
  </p>
  <p>
    When exporting a story, we create a temporary sequence album on your device to enable seamless Instagram posting.
    Exported photos remain on your device unless you delete them manually.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    StoryStack may integrate with optional third-party services such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Supabase</strong> – for user authentication and secure backend storage</li>
    <li><strong>Dropbox, Google Drive</strong> – if you choose to import photos from connected folders</li>
    <li><strong>OpenAI / GPT-4 Vision</strong> – if you enable AI tagging features</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These services operate under their own privacy policies. We never provide these services 
    with access to your account credentials or any unnecessary personal data.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    StoryStack is not intended for use by children under 13. 
    We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We follow industry best practices to keep your information safe, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Encrypted network connections (HTTPS/TLS)</li>
    <li>Hashed and salted passwords</li>
    <li>Private user-specific storage buckets</li>
    <li>Restricted internal access</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You may request:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Deletion of your account and all stored photos</li>
    <li>A copy of the data associated with your account</li>
    <li>Correction of inaccurate information</li>
  </ul>
